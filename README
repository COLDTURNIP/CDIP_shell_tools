CDIP - COLDTURNIP's Developemnt Integrated Preparation shell tools
==================================================================

-----------
Requirement
-----------

The following tools are required:

  * scons:
      a building system for install/uninstall

  * ctags & cscope:
      tagging tools for building tags in codebases

  * awk (or other extensions over the 7th Edition AWK):
      to showing the progressing bar

  NOTE: if your awk doesn't support AWK 7e (e.g. default mawk in Ubuntu 10.10),
        then the "buildtag" function may not work.

These tools assumes that your codebases are placed under the following
directories: $HOME/worksrc/ and $HOME/mysrc/ . If not, please modify the
"goproj" function in the cdipPathUtils.sh .


-----------------
Install/Uninstall
-----------------

Basic install:

  $ cd path/to/CDIP_shell_tools
  $ [PREFIX=your/installation/path] scons install

  note that the default PREFIX is your $HOME .
  After that, add the following two lines at the end of your .bashrc file
  
  . your/installation/path/bin/cdipPathUtils.sh
  . your/installation/path/bin/cdipSrcUtils.sh


Uninstall:

  $ cd path/to/CDIP_shell_tools
  $ scons -c install

  and do not forget to  remove unnecessary lines in your .bashrc file.


-----
Usage
-----

Initialize a new codebase:

  $ mkdir path/to/codebase
  $ cd path/to/codebase
  $ initproj

  then edit the path/to/codebase/.cdip/envsetup.sh if need. After
  initialization, use goproj command to load the settings.


Jump to the specific codebase and load the local settings in the codebase:

  $ goproj [project_name]

  if you left the name empty, it will list all the codebases out.


Jump to the root of the codebase:

  $ croot


Set root path to specific directory:

  $ settop [path]
  the default path is current work directory $PWD


Build searching cache and source tag files under the codebase:

  $ buildtag
  this may take some minutes. You may need to do this after makeing some
  big changes to the codebase (e.g. repo sync).


Searching strings in the codebase:

  for example, searching "android" in *.xml
  $ xmlgrep "android"

  currently, we support the following source files:
    * C/C++: *.c, *.cpp, *.h, *.hpp
    * Java: *.java
    * Python: *.py
    * Google Go: *.go
    * Vala: *.vala, *.vapi
    * GNU Make: Makefile, Makefile.*, *.make, *.mak, *.mk


Reload .bashrc without logout

  $ reload


---------------
VIM Integration
---------------

If you're using VIM and using Cscope plugin, the vimball cdip_shell_tools.vba
can help you the load tag files autometically when you open any source files
in the code base. Just open it with VIM and use ":so %" command to install it.

If your Cscope installation path is not in your $PATH, then you'll need to
add

    set csprg=~/bin/cscope

in your .vimrc file.
